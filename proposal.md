Project Proposal
===
##Brief Explanation of Idea
Mental health is a broad and complicated subject. We want to present people with statistics and information about mental health and suicide in a way that gives people the opportunity to engage with the data both rationally and on an emotional level. By giving site visitors the opportunity to fill out various short surveys about their life and experiences, they can get a sense of how their life relates.

We provide two main things. Firstly, we provide an interactive overview of various statistics relating to mental health and suicide, aggregated from various high quality sources. On top of normal ways of exploring this data, we also provide users with the ability to answer basic questions about themselves or their experiences to see how their responses compare to aggregate data. We will only store anonymized data collected in our surveys.
